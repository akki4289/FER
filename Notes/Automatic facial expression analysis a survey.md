#Automatic facial expression analysis: a survey

##Abstract
Over the last decade, automatic facial expression analysis has become an active research area that finds potential applications in areas such as more engaging humanâ€“computer interfaces, talking heads, image retrieval and human emotion analysis. Facial expressions reflect not only emotions, but other mental activities, social interaction and physiological signals. In this survey, we introduce the most prominent automatic facial expression analysis methods and systems presented in the literature. Facial motion and deformation extraction approaches as well as classification methods are discussed with respect to issues such as face normalization, facial expression dynamics and facial expression intensity, but also with regard to their robustness towards environmental changes.

##Some Notes

Facial expression analysis goes back into the 19th century.

Six primary emotions where introduced in 1971, by Ekman and Friesen. Each of these emotions have a unique facial expression. They are called the basic emotions.
They are *happiness*, *sadness*, *fear*, *disgust*, *surprise* and *anger*.
