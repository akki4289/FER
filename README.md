#FER : Facial Expression Recognition

...

##Dependencies

###LibSVM >= 3.11

I've include built libraries and python bindings in this project for windows.

In result this won't work outside windows. That's a shame on me! I'll try to fix that

###scikit-learn

This is not included.

You can find it at (scikit-learn.org)[http://scikit-learn.org/stable/].

I've used this for PCA.
